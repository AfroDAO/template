Also, you can set the block explorer view options, like thousands and decimals separator character format, using commas or dots as separators. You can set the number of decimals you want to show in the Block Explorer for each transaction and the date format, which uses a standard PHP date format syntax.

Finally, you can set a cache option for your block explorer, to improve loading time and reduce the calls to Etherscan API. You can set a time for your cache ranging from no cache at all, to a one week cache. Usually, a cache of a few minutes will be enough depending on the activity of your token.
