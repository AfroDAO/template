 * Tweak: For extension compatibility, cart item update requests that target specific cart keys do not remove + re-add cart items, to avoid deleting sensitive cart item data required by other extensions. Instead, cart item quantities are simply updated as usual.
 * Tweak: Unhook 'WC_Form_Handler::add_to_cart_action' from 'init' in OPC pages, to prevent products from being added to the cart when submitting an order
 * Tweak: More consistent use of 'wcopc_' prefix for actions/filters
 * Tweak: Only scroll to checkout form messages and notices when they are not already in the viewport
 * Tweak: If using a custom add-to-cart link, change the success message from WooCommerce's default "added to cart" to "added to order" and mention that order can be completed at the bottom of the page
 * Tweak: If using an add-to-cart link outside the OPC product selection fields, display the success or error notice at the top of the page, rather than the top of the checkout form (which may be further down the page)
 * Tweak: If using an add-to-cart link outside the OPC product selection fields, redirect the customer to a URL without the 'add-to-cart=ID' param to avoid adding the product to the cart when refreshing the page
